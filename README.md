# jmc-flame-view
Community collaboration to provide a view that renders stacktrace selections as flame graphs in Mission Control.

# Note that this code is now contributed to the JMC project.
For the latest version, check the JDK Mission Control repo at https://github.com/openjdk/jmc.

This plug-in should provide a good example for how to use JavaScript visualization technologies to render complex information from java flight recordings in JDK Mission Control.

To start working on the flame-view, and to test the flame-view:

1. First import the JMC project into Eclipse.
2. Don't forget to import the launchers.
3. Copy and rename one of the launchers (for example the JMC RCP plug-ins launcher), to have your own launcher configuration.
4. Import the two eclipse projects (the plug-in and the feature projects) from this repo into your eclipse.
5. Add org.openjdk.jmc.feature.flightrecorder.ext.flamegraph to the features to launch in your launcher.
6. Launch JMC from within Eclipse with your new launcher.

To use the view in JMC:

1. Go to Window | Show View | Other...
2. Select Mission Control / Flame View
3. Put the view where you want it, and select something in the UI that normally has a stack trace aggregate, for example something from the Memory page, or something from the Method Profiling page
